# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## 1. Analysis Overview
For this analysis, we broke down a very large data set of every employee in the company to see who will be eligible for retirement soon. This analysis is very important for Pewlett-Hackard's Human Resources team to know because all of the positions that retirement-eligible employees are currently holding must be filled as swiftly as possible once our employees retire and the position becomes open. Conducting this analysis will give HR advance notice for all of the positions that will soon be open and will then allow them to hire new employees to take over and foster a smooth transition.

## 2. Results 
 ### Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
* We created a comprehensive list of employees eligible for retirement, including each employee's name and title. An example can be seen below:

* The table we created in the above step is absolutely massive - it shows that there are over 70,000 employees that will soon be eligible for retirement!
* We also created a table to display the employees that are eligible for the mentorship program for new hires. This table included employee names and titles as well. This table can be seen below:

* This table will also be very useful for the company HR to have, as it will be much easier to work on implementing the mentorship program knowing exactly how many and which employees are eligible. 

## 3. Concluding Summary 
* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
*   There will be 72,548 retiring employees according to our analysis.
* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
* There are not. Per the "mentorship_eligibility" table we created, there are 1,549 eligible employees for the mentorship program.
